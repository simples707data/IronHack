-- Once you've defined how to classify clients as valuable / not valuable, you could:
	-- describe both classifications of clients based on information you'll find across the other tables
    -- for example, where do they live, how much money do they move frequently, how old are they, 
    -- you could dive into a deeper analysis of customer behaviour
    -- for example, digging into the bigger loans (riskier liabilities), how many payments do they make on those loans, to whom/where, what type 
    
    
-- You could also assess if the bank has more or less of this classification of customerover time
