### Logistical Regression on the Iris dataset. 

Applying the logistical regression model from sklearn to the puzzel of identifying different Irises based on some measuremnts from the plants. (stem lenght etc)


#### EDA and Cleaning:
Did this in one step - adjusting as issues were spotted.

#### Visaul EDA and removing outliers:
Removed outliers - which were pronounced because the data set was very small (150 entires in total)

#### Normalsing and running the model. 
At this point I was just copy pasting. But I did understand more or less how the code was working and was able to adjust to fit this different data set. - most notalby understanding how to crewte a binary question where there were three options (= answer one at a time. Is it a? yes no, is it b) yes no, is it c) yes no)

#### Results
97% accuracy is probably much too high for such a small data set. However, it is possible that the three iris types are very distinct and therefore easy to differenciate even with a small sample size. 

#### Reveiw
It was good to work with others. Sometimes I just go off on my own. But worked better today in a breakout room where I could chekc in with other people when I got stuck.
I dont really understand how the models work. But am not too worried about this. 
I was pleased to get the data cleaning and wrangling done quite efficiently. 

The first Python based lab that I have finished on time and somewhat to my satisfaction - so pleased with this
